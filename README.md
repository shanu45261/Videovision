# Video Vision: AI-Powered Video Analysis

## Overview
**Video Vision** is an AI-powered video analysis framework that integrates **ResNet, CNNs, and RNNs** to enhance video understanding without relying on extensive labeled datasets. Unlike traditional methods that struggle with capturing both **spatial and temporal** features, this approach leverages deep learning architectures for improved scalability and efficiency.

## Features
- **Spatial-Temporal Feature Extraction**: Uses **ResNet** for spatial feature extraction and **RNNs** for temporal sequence modeling.
- **Reduced Dependence on Labeled Data**: Employs **self-supervised learning** and **unsupervised techniques** to improve video understanding.
- **End-to-End Video Processing**: Supports **frame extraction, feature embedding, and sequence modeling**.
- **Modular & Scalable**: Easily extensible for various video analysis tasks like **action recognition, anomaly detection, and object tracking**.

## Architecture
1. **Frame Extraction**: Preprocesses video frames and normalizes input.
2. **ResNet Backbone**: Extracts spatial features from video frames.
3. **CNN Feature Refinement**: Enhances extracted features for better representation.
4. **RNN Sequence Modeling**: Captures temporal dependencies between frames.
5. **Classification/Prediction Module**: Outputs video insights based on learned features.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- TensorFlow / PyTorch
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Dataset
This model can be trained on **Kinetics-400**, **UCF101**, or any custom dataset with minimal labeled data.

## Roadmap
- [ ] Implement Transformer-based enhancements (e.g., **ViTs**)
- [ ] Optimize for **real-time processing**
- [ ] Deploy as an **API or Web App**
